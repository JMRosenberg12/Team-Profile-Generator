As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info, so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. First things first! Download the test folder & package.json. Create js and html files for Employee, Manager, Intern, & Engineer. Create an index.js! Be sure to make a package-lock.json file. Gitignore the node modules folder! Make sure you don't miss something before noding index.js. answer questions in terminal and add more employee cards while generating to team.html.
